If only your opponent controls a monster, you can Normal Summon this card without Tributes, and if you do, this card\u0027 original ATK becomes 1900. If this card attacks a Defense Position monster, inflict piercing battle damage to your opponent. If this card destroyed a Fiend or Zombie monster by battle, it is banished instead of being sent to the GY.\n\nConcept by MauGamesLOL",
