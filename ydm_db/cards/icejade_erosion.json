If a face-up WATER monster(s) you control leaves the field by your opponent, except by being destroyed (except during the Damage Step): You can take 1 \"Icejade\" monster from your Deck, and either add it to your hand or Special Summon it. You can only use each effect of \"Icejade Erosion\" once per turn.",
