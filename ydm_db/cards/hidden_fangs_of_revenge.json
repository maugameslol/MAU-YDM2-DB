When a monster declares an attack: Destroy 2 Set cards you control, and if you do, negate that attack, then, if any Monster Cards were destroyed by this effect and sent to the GY, choose 1 and destroy as many monsters your opponent controls as possible with ATK less than or equal to that monster\u0027s DEF, then it becomes the End Phase. You can only activate 1 \"Hidden Fangs of Revenge\" per turn.",
