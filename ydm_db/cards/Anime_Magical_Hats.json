When this card is activated: Choose up to 4 monsters (min. 1) in your Monster Zones and for every monster not chosen, choose a \"Magical Hats\" from your hand, Deck or GY. Special Summon them as Normal Monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) in face-down Defense Position (They are still treated as Spell cards), Set the chosen monsters if they are face-up, and shuffle them on the field. If you flip up a face-down monster or Spell Cards Summoned by the effect of \"Magical Hats\", send all Spell Cards in your Monster Zones to the GY. Face-down Spell Cards in your Monster Zones cannot be Tributed or used as Extra Deck Material, and you cannot Summon/Set monsters while there are face-down Spell Cards in your Monster Zones. You can only activate \"Magical Hats\" once per turn.",
