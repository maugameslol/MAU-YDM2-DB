After this card\u0027s activation, it remains on the field, but you must destroy it if a monster or Spell or Trap Card in your Monster Zone(s) is flipped face-up. When this card is activated: Choose up to 4 monsters in your Monster Zones and for every monster not chosen, choose Spell or Trap Cards from your Deck or hand. Special Summon them as Normal Monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) in face-down Defense Position, Set the chosen monsters if they are face-up, and shuffle them on the field. If a Spell/Trap Card in your Monster Zone is targeted by your opponent for an attack or card effect, you can place it face-up in your Spell/Trap Zone and activate its effect(s) if possible. (If not, it is sent to the GY.) If this card leaves the field, or if you flip up a monster, Spell or Trap Card Set by the effect of \"Magical Hats\", send all Spell and Trap Cards in your Monster Zones to the GY. Face-down Spell and Trap Cards in your Monster Zones cannot be Tributed, and you cannot Summon/Set monsters while there is a face-up \"Magical Hats\", except by the effect of \"Magical Hats\". You can only control 1 face-up \"Magical Hats\", and you can only activate \"Magical Hats\" once per turn.",
