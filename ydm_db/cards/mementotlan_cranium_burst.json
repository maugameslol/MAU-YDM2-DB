When your opponent activates a monster effect on the field (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 \"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation\" you control; it loses exactly 1000 ATK/DEF, and if it does, negate that activated effect. You can only activate this effect of \"Mementotlan Cranium Burst\" once per Chain.",
