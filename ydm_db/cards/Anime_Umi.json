Both players can change face-down Defense Position WATER monsters they control to face-up Attack Position when attacked. During their Main Phase, the turn player can change WATER monsters they control to face-down Defense Position. If \"Full Moon\" or \"Mystical Moon\" is on the field, your opponent can only control 1 non-WATER monster. If a \"Full Moon\" or \"Mystical Moon\" on the field is destroyed, destroy this card. If this card leaves the field, flip all monsters you control face-up.",
