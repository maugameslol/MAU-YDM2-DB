# Mau's YDM2-DB Fork
This is for use in my private server among friends. If you want to make your own "Database", I suggest forking the [original YDM "Database".](https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YDM2-DB)

[JustBryant's YDM Database](https://github.com/JustBryant/YDM2-DB-1) and [Odion1's YDM Database](https://github.com/Odion1/YDM2-DB-1) for cards past the vanilla YDM database. I only use the official cards provided from these databases. If I am doing anything wrong, contact me in the official YDM discord.
