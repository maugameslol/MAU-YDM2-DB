# Mau's YDM2-DB Fork
This is for use in my private server among friends. 

There are custom cards and sets in here, alongside the original cards. There are also files in here that are not compatible with the base mod.

If you want to make your own "Database", I suggest forking the [original YDM "Database".](https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YDM2-DB)

## Original Ygo Dueling Mod Repository:
Original Mod:
[https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YgoDuelingMod](https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YgoDuelingMod)

Original Database:
[https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YDM2-DB](https://github.com/CAS-ual-TY/YDM2-DB)

[JustBryant's YDM Database](https://github.com/JustBryant/YDM2-DB-1) and [Odion1's YDM Database](https://github.com/Odion1/YDM2-DB-1) for cards past the vanilla YDM database. I only use the official cards provided from these databases. If I am doing anything wrong, contact me in the official YDM discord.
